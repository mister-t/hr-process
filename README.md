If you savor technical challenges, a no-bs culture, and significant equities, I would love to have a chat with you!!

Book a time at your convenience to learn more: https://calendly.com/yuxin-replo/15min

Looking forward to hearing from you!


Yuxin Zhu

```

### Cadence

1. One to two days on initial outreach after ID’ing potential candidate
2. Follow-up if no response in a week
3. Send another follow-up if no response in a week; emphasize urgency & flexible accommodation of the position if needed .
4. Close the loop if no response yet again by sending a final, gentle reminder to reach out if their situation changes.

## 3. Sourcing

### Thoughts

Like a ship, if we do not have a good map, we are lost. In our case, the map is the job description. From experience as a software engineer, I notice that a lot of companies just copy & paste, then make some minor changes. It turns software engineers off, since they can not discern the differences from other companies.

A more proactive approach & example is the [postings from Ashby](https://www.ashbyhq.com/careers?ashby_jid=f99c1c4a-07f5-42fa-987e-de9a93f945dd). It's long but details every sort of expectations, thus holding engineers to a certain standard of excellence. Especially revealing are the sections on why you **should** or **should not** apply. Startups are chaotic, but it doesn't have to be uncertain. People need assurances that the leadership knows where they are going.

### Process with channels & tools

An under-utitlized channel is local meetups or tech events/conferences. I personally go to meetups (in SF) frequently at various places, and they often have open-mics at the end for announcements. While mingling with other attendees, they often have friends or colleagues looking for new challenges.

For the channels/sources with boolean search/hiring tools, here's a list:

1. Internal Referrals from current employees
2. WorkAtAStartup
3. HackerNews's monthly "Who wants to be hired"
4. LinkedIn
5. Angel List
6. Stackoverflow profiles - top answerers
7. Github profiles - starred repos
8. CrunchBoard
9. Dice
10. Indeed
11. Hired

Lastly, we can also use various scraping tools to consolidate potential candidates and sift through them after ingesting the data into our system. An [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApgVkG2Mofk) is using apollo.io to look for potential candidates and scrape the results page.

## 4. Interview Questions

1. Are you more comfortable in the frontend or the backend? (It’s rare that someone is good on both)
2. Could you describe what scalable means to you in software engineering? Please feel free to use past FE/BE experiences, maybe a favorite work project.
3. What are some of the performance metrics & techniques you employ to make sure you app is performant? How do you decide when to use SSG, SWR, and ISR? Again, please feel free to use examples from past experiences.
